Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21



#---------------------------------------------

Certainly! The lines you're asking about are used to handle potential integer overflow issues when reversing the integer. Let's break it down step by step.

Background:
In many programming environments, integers are represented using 32 bits. This means the range of values a 32-bit signed integer can hold is from  -2**31 to 2**31 -1
 which is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

When reversing the digits of an integer, there is a possibility that the resulting number could exceed these bounds. If the reversed integer falls outside this range, it would overflow and not be representable as a 32-bit integer.

Code Explanation:
python
Copy code
if reversed_int < -2**31 or reversed_int > 2**31 - 1:
    return 0
Here's what each part does:

reversed_int < -2**31:

This checks if the reversed integer is less than 
−
2
31
−2 
31
 . If reversed_int is smaller than -2,147,483,648, it is too small to be represented as a 32-bit signed integer.
reversed_int > 2**31 - 1:

This checks if the reversed integer is greater than 
2
31
−
1
2 
31
 −1. If reversed_int is larger than 2,147,483,647, it is too large to be represented as a 32-bit signed integer.
return 0:

If either of the above conditions is true (meaning the reversed integer is out of the 32-bit integer range), the function returns 0. This is a common way to indicate that an overflow has occurred.
